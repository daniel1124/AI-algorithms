# Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

A collection of course projects and programs I wrote as self-studies.

- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening
- Breadth first search, uniform cost search, A* search, bi-directional search, tri-directional search
- Baysian network inference
- Guassian Mixture model implementation
- Random forest implementation
- Hidden Markov model, Viterbi algorithm, Forward-backward algorithm
